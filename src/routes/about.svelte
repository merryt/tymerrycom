	<h1>Who is Tyler Merry?</h1>
	<p>
		In the past I have been called a designer who does some dev stuff. Lately I have shifted to more
		of a developer who sometimes does design work. I have spoken at a few small meetups, and helped
		technical review books, but my favorite thing to do is to volunteer at the library teaching kids
		to code, and at a local bike shop that helps people fix their bikes for free/cheap. I am a
		lifelong learner and helper. For a picture of what I prioritize in live checkout<a

		>. I currently live in Colorado and
		<a href="http://travelsaveandbemerry.com/">love to travel</a>. Some of my favorite places so far
		have been Ljubljana and Kuala Lumpur. I like to build silly little programs that do stuff like
