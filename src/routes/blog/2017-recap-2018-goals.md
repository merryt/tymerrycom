Every year I try to document out what I am trying to accomplish the next year. As one might expect I don\'t always get my goals, but it\'s nice to have a good outline. [Here](http://tymerry.com/2016-accomplishments-and-2017-goals/) is my post from last year.

## 2017 ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### CAREER

- Maintained and grew a Denver UX to 1951 members. The meetup did two events a month

- Got a great new job

- Gave talks on both design and development

### PERSONAL

- Wrote 4 blog posts for [tymerry.com](https://www.tymerry.com/2017-recap-2018-goals/tymerry.com) and 10 blog posts for [TravelSaveandBeMerry](http://travelsaveandbemerry.com/). My goal was 12 blog posts, so beat it by two

- Volunteered at library teaching design and development.

- was able to do 3 pull-ups and bench 135, but then stopped exercising.

- Did several trips with only a small backpack, proving I can do some pretty minimalist travel

- Reached a state of \"blank slate\". Money, time, flexibility are no longer limiting factors in my life

- Created a bucket list

### FINANCIAL

- Savings rate greater than 65%

- Passed the 1/2 way point to financial independence

### MISSED GOALS

- Didn\'t updated blogs to the latest version of ghost

- I set several goals that weren\'t really definable for success or failure

## 2018 GOALS

- Read 12 books

- Write 12 blog posts

- Get a solo chicken dinner in PUBG

- Define who I want to be, this will be shown in something like [Zen of Python]

- Be comfortable saying \"I am a developer\" (be able to create a CRUD app from scratch and have an example)

- Generate \$1 from a business that isn\'t consulting/contracting
