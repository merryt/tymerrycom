Who is Tyler Merry?

In the past I have been called a designer who does some dev stuff. Lately I have shifted to more of a developer who sometimes does design work. I have spoken at a few small meetups, and helped technical review books, but my favorite thing to do is to volunteer at the library teaching kids to code, and at a local bike shop that helps people fix their bikes for free/cheap.

I am a lifelong learner and helper. For a picture of what I prioritize in live checkout [my goals from 2018](http://www.tymerry.com/2017-recap-2018-goals.html). I currently live in Colorado and [love to travel](http://travelsaveandbemerry.com/). Some of my favorite places so far have been Ljubljana and Kuala Lumpur. I work for a company called [The Motley Fool](http://fool.com) as a developer doing python and front end dev.

I like to build silly little programs that do stuff like tell you [what games on twitch are getting a lot of viewers](https://tymerry.com/best-game-to-stream.html) or financial calculators [https://tymerry-calculators.netlify.com/](https://tymerry-calculators.netlify.com/).
