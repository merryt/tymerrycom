Page performance is like black magic

To fix:

- Set a goal

  - \~1s page load-

  - Speed index of less then 1k

  - Max 200ms server responce time

- Text your site

  - [http://www.webpagetest.org/]

  - Google PageSpeed Insights

- Slowness is generated little by little.

  - Every un-optimised image,

  - Every bloaty css or js library

  - Just adds to your slugishness

- Use your tools

  - Grunt/gulp

    - minimize your code!

    - optimize your images!

- Remove un-used CSS

  - Bootstrap can be over kill! Most people

  - Most projects I am on that use bootstrap have \~85% unused or overwritten bootstrap code

- UnCSS

  - Removes unused CSS

  - There is a grunt and gulp task to help with this.

    - grunt-uncss

    - gulp-uncss

- This is great for projects using bootstrap

- CSS Regression testing

  - helpfull for end to end testing

  - Tools- Will show visual percentage changed, useful during optimization stages to make sure you didn't blow up all your stuff

    - PhantomJS --- Scriptable headless browser

    - CasperJS --- Navigation scripting & caching

    - PhantomCSS --- Screenshot and comparison library

- Optimize Critical Path CSS

  - Get content shown AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!

- Tools npm install grunt-perfbudget

  - PageSpeedInsights CLI --- psi (with grunt pluggin)

  - phantoms CLI (with grunt pluggin)

  - Parker --- CSS anilytics
