I have played chess since I was a little kid. After reading Atomic Habits and Ultra Learning I have decided I am going to get a little bit more serious about chess. If you are curious about what that looks like you can check out [my improvement plan](/chess/). I am hoping I can get my blitz, rapid, and classic ratings on Lichess.com all above the average on the sites. 3 weeks in I have gotten there with Rapid, so I have two game types to go!
