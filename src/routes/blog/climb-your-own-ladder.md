In life, everyone is climbing their own respective ladder, because you are constantly focused on climbing all you do is see the people above you and feel like you have barely left the ground. They are also climbing, so you never realize you are making progress. There are some people on the ladder who have stopped climbing, and are just looking at the people who are beneath and besides them. These people don't understand how much more ladder there is to climb, because they stopped setting their eyes forward. These people will motivate you to stay put, because it validates their decision to stop climbing. Some days you listen to them and are lazy, some days you chase the people ahead of you. The only time you feel accomplishment is by comparing where you are on your personal ladder now to where you had been in the past and seeing just how far you\'ve come.
