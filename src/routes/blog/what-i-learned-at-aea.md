- Performance isn\'t a bolt on addition, its user experience, and it needs to be thought about from the begining

- [http://stylifyme.com/]

- What will I do: write a blog post

- [http://www.webpagetest.org/]

- We can use more exciting layouts, it doesn\'t NEED to be columns

- Mockup magazines on the web

- Unified UX - Cameron Moll

- Experiences have to be similar, users expect CNN to look like CNN

- Do not say \"click this button\" sometimes it should be \"tap this button\"

- Content for zombies

- the theme of this event is definitely about content.

- Content should be broken up into small chunks that are digestible from the presentation layer.

- [image of change]

- Everyone is customer service

- The idea that you are spending budget to do user testing is really weird, people complaining that about your product\... USER THAT feedback

- Have non-customer support people do customer support

- Try and talk to the people doing support as much as possible!

- Being successful isn\'t a super simple formula, Matt Haughey thinks listening to your customers increases your chances of being successful.
