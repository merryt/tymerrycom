I received a question today that reads:

> _I have a line on a possible job, and they are asking for one. Bad

> _Any suggestions or resources?_

I am of the principle that one portfolio is enough to get a conversation
going, but in order to get the job and create the most confidence for
your employer you should consider having 2 or potentially 3 portfolios.

1.  Personal portfolio. The personal portfolio should be projects you
    have enjoyed working on and you believe came out well. Of all the
    portfolios you have, this is the most generic. This can be varying
    sizes, from 3 or 4 pieces on the small side, to hundreds on the
    large size. Normally there isn\'t really a focus for the TYPE of
    work, so you will see everything from T-Shirt design, to model
    airplane painting, to ux, to cooking, to photography. For example
    check out

    done by the great Dan Cederholm or my behance site,

    .

2.  Career portfolio. Some people opt to skip the more generic portfolio
    above and go straight for a targeted portfolio, I am calling this
    portfolio your career portfolio. This portfolio should start to
    develop a specific focus that aligns with the jobs you are looking
    for. If you are building a portfolio for UX it should show your
    end to end process. This means a couple pictures of you conducting
    interviews, followed by some example personas, and journey maps.
    Then perhaps some wireframes, and lastly a couple screen shots of
    the finished products. For example:

3.  Job focused portfolio. When you get a specific job you are looking
    for, chances are they have a specific set of requirements. This is
    your opportunity to set yourself apart from the compilation. Use
    the job description as a todo list for your portfolio, everything
    listed as a requirement and \"nice to have\" in the job
    description should be represented in the portfolio.

Having all three isn\'t essential to getting a job. That being said, an
employer will always feel like you care, and are willing to go the extra
mile when then receive a link to yoururl.com/their-company/ or a PDF
portfolio with their logo, and a copy of your cover letter in it.
