1. **First analyze the game yourself without the help of an engine(computer).**
2. **Find out mistakes yourself**
- Where you went wrong Tactically  
- After which move, game has changed itâ€™s flow of direction (This is to point out your strategical or minor mistakes)  
- At which position I was clueless (have no plan)  
3. **Then Analyze the game with an engine**
- Run through the different options you thought about making during the game
4. **Make a list of your mistakes on a paper.**
