	<h1>What I use</h1>
	I have a very small collection of things that I use very frequently. For the past few months I have
	been traveling so my office/desk supplies are very much limited to what the plalce I am staying has
	on has.

	<h2>What do I use daily?</h2>
	<strong>Physical Things</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Tom Bign Synapse</strong> - All my stuff when I travel location to location is stored in
			carried around in a 25L backpack. I choose the Synapse mostly because of all the positive reviews
			it has gotten online. I like it well enough, but probably not worth the price when so many other
			great backpacks are out there
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Asus ROG g14</strong> - My daily driver computer is a 14 inch Asus laptop. I originally
			got it because I liked having a high powered video card+processor. I will probably end up running
			linux on it shortly because my window management solution on windows is lacking
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Nexstand</strong> - This is a knock off roost stand. Inhindsight I would have given the
			money to the original creators and gotten the slightly smaller version to save a little bit of
			weight
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>NuPhy Air v75</strong> Has been working great for me so far, probably could have saved
			a little weight and size going with the v60, but the switches and keycaps are great. I have tried
			a slew of mechanical keyboards in a variety of configurations. I previously traveled with a WASD
			tkl, it was a bit larger but it worked.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<strong>Software</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Anki</strong> - Open source flashcard program. I use it on both computer + phone. I throw
			small facts that I need to recall quickly in there and drill myself daily
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Memrise</strong> - I previously used duolingo + anki for vocab, but I have been enjoying
			memrise a bit more lately. Both are probably a worse choice then talking with someone and making
			mistakes.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>VSCode</strong> - I spent some time getting good at emacs but it felt like my ide was broken
			20% of the time and it was turning into a barrier to learning anything other then emacs
		</li>
	</ul>
