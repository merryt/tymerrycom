### BUSINESS CHALLENGE

While working at **Universal Mind**, I worked with AT&T managed security
services (MSS) to analyze their business goals, success criteria, subject matter
expert’s priorities, cultural impacts, consumer feedback, user experience, and
technology capabilities with the intent to consolidate and differentiate MSS’s
service offerings across digital touch points.

**Network security is expensive, and – most of the time – confusing.**. Everyone
knows this — AT&T has spent years simplifying this complicated space and
bringing the cost of large-scale network protection and recovery down. Over this
time they have partnered, acquired, or built over two dozen tools all with
specific strengths and weaknesses, but much to the dismay of those selling the
products there was a large overlap between product offerings.

Our challenge in this application was to consolidate an extensive list of
security offerings in a way that makes sense to sales teams and customers, while
still giving users their full list of features they expect.

My specific role on this project was leading the User experience and strategy
team. The team consisted of a strategist, a UX specialist, and myself. Also on
the project was a technical architect and a project manager.

### PROCESS

I used both their strategic and experience focused approach, concentrating on
identifying a visionary path forward to facilitate alignment as AT&T transitioned
from theoretical to practical. The process, designed to be iterative, involved 62 interviews, split between
customers, sales teams, and subject matter expert interviews. From kickoff to
final presentation the full project lasted 3 months. It resulted in
recommendations to advance the managed security services offerings supported by
journey maps, personas, strategic themes, an experience vision, a cultural
analysis, a competitive analysis, and a technical analysis of their suite of
offerings.

### PERSONAS

A Persona is a summary of a set of users of a product articulated as an
individual. For AT&T we did Personas, or User Roles, on both the customers and
members of the sales team.

Personas
​​​​​​​Personas

Personas are built through direct interviews with users, capturing observed
patterns of behaviors and attitudes. They come in a variety of sizes most
commonly there is an executive summary expressed in a single page or slide and a
specific section and a detailed section that contains all the information that
designers use to build educated decision. The entire population of potential
users should ideally be able to be represented by all the personas created for
the project.

### JOURNEY MAPS

A Customer Journey Map walks decision makers down the path that users have to
travel every day. It calls out the highs and the lows that a user experiences
within a process of flow.

For AT&T we realized that AT&T had a strong suite of offered products but the
sales and installation process was opaque and confusing.

Utilizing our experience doing frequent quick research studies we were able to
make small changes before problems got too large to fix.

### CULTURAL AND COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

A Cultural Analysis addresses the Purposes, Practices, and People of an
organization and compares them to the other companies in the space.

What is happening internally is only part of the picture — AT&T had spent years
growing its relationships with its customers, and with its internal stakeholders, but competitors are changing daily.

It is important to know where you compare to others in the space.

### EXPERIENCE VISION

Gaining empathy with an IT Manager’s user experience can be extremely
challenging. In order to assist we built an Experience Vision that explains what
Henry, our IT manager, would experience as he purchases and uses his AT&T
Managed Security Service suite of software. This ideal state allows everyone on
the team to align on what the customer experience should look like in an ideal
state and build to that state.

### SOLUTION

Our solution to AT&Ts problem was an outline to consolidate, improve, and
in-house their existing offerings. The final deliverable contained a roadmap to
upgrading their Sales, CX, Training, and Alignment. Also outlined technical
recommendations needed to build a reusable platform to increase agility and
mobility for consolidation efforts as well as streamlined ways to deploy their existing software

### RESULTS

AT&T remains competitive and one of the market leaders in a space that is
constantly improving and reinventing themselves.
