### GENOS BACKGROUND

Complete Genomics is a company that provides human genome sequencing. **Universal Mind** originally engaged Complete Genomics to build out an interface that allows genetic researchers to visualize and annotate their findings. They realized that much of the technology used to power this researcher offering could power the back-end of a consumer product as well, and so Complete Genomics partnered with Universal Mind to build Genos: a next generation genetic insight platform for consumers similar to 23andMe or Ancestry.com.

The platform allows users to get sequenced, explore their genetic data, share that data with friends, and engage with researchers. Genos consists of 5 core areas: Traits, Ancestry, the Explorer, Conditions, and Drug Response.

Genos sets its self apart from competition through simplicity, data privacy, data portability, and ability to sequence your whole genome. Competitors only sequence part of the genome (specifically the “exome”) and sell the user’s genome to researchers themselves; On Genos customers own their genetic data, choose for themselves whether to license it out, and benefit from research if they do both financially and by getting personal reports on the latest findings their information helped to uncover.

My role on this project started as a front end developer and UX specialist, but over time grew into UX team lead.

### BUSINESS CHALLENGE

Complete Genomics Partnered with Universal Mind and frog design to build out a consumer portal that would allow regular folks to visualize and understand the information locked in their DNA through a new SAAS product called “Genos”

Genetic research is a young and fairly weak science. During the project competitors were shut down, and the whole space was at risk for government investigation for over-promising on uncertain correlations between specific genetic conditions and a person’s DNA. Universal Mind had to navigate these complications and provide value to both Complete Genomics and the user in this design.

### Genomics is Confusing.

I get it — genomics is a relatively new science, and most people haven’t reviewed ”genetics 101” since high school biology.

Our challenge in this application was to make genetic information accessible, educational and intuitive. frog design had the task of designing out the user’s landing page and Universal Mind got to tackle the “Genome Explorer”, where the user could get deep into the weeds of their genetic data.

We were instructed not to pull any punches — prior research had shown that there was a place in the market for a detailed and advanced personal genome exploration project, and that’s what our stakeholders intended Genos to become.

### Giving Context

Your DNA consists of 3 billion base pairs which reside in 23 pairs of chromosomes, This is a lot of data to expose to a user at a single point in time. To help users understand how chromosomes, genes, and DNA all relate, the explorer uses HTML5 and CSS3 animation and transformation to walk a user through their genome and explain each step along the way from their full genome down to a single base-pair of DNA.
